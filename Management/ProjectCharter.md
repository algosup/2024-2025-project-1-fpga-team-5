# Project FPGA - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to recreate the video game Frogger in FPGA. The game will be displayed on a VGA screen.

## Scope

This project must be done using FPGA and Verilog. The game must be a clone of the original Frogger game. The game must be displayed on a VGA screen. The game must be controlled using the buttons located on the FPGA Go-Board.

This project required us to replicate the game as close as possible to the original game.
