## I. Introduction

### 1. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Frogger | Frogger is a classic arcade game developed by Konami and released in 1981. The game involves guiding a frog across a busy road and river, avoiding obstacles and hazards along the way. |
| FPGA | Field-Programmable Gate Array `Definition still in progress...`|
| HDL | Hardware Description Language `Definition still in progress...`|
| Verilog | Verilog is a HDL used to model electronic systems. It is commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits. |
| VGA | Video Graphics Array `Definition still in progress...`|

### 2. Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the classic arcade game **Frogger** on an FPGA platform. 

### 3. Project Definition

#### Vision

The vision of this project is to provide an interactive and engaging gaming experience that pays homage to the classic arcade game Frogger. By leveraging the capabilities of FPGA technology, we aim to create a faithful recreation of the original game with enhanced graphics and gameplay features.

This game will be designed to appeal to both nostalgic players who remember the original Frogger and new players who are looking for a fun and challenging gaming experience.

#### Objectives

   - **Technology**: Implement the game logic and graphics using Verilog HDL on an FPGA platform.
   - **Gameplay**: Recreate the classic Frogger gameplay with enhanced graphics and additional features.

#### Scope

This project will be developped on a "[Go-Board](https://nandland.com/the-go-board/)" FPGA platform. Using Verilog HDL, we will implement the game logic, graphics, and user interface elements required to recreate the classic Frogger game.

#### Target Audience

The target audience for this project includes:
   - Fans of classic arcade games who are familiar with the original Frogger.
   - Players looking for a challenging and engaging gaming experience.
   - Students and hobbyists interested in FPGA development and game design.

#### Deliverables

The main deliverables is the source code of the game, supported by multiple version of this game and mockups of the design.

Other deliverables include:
   - Functional Specification Document
   - Technical Specification Document
   - User Manual
   - Test Plan and Test Cases
   - Management Plan & Weekly reports
