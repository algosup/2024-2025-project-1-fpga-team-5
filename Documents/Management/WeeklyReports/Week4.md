# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This week was the final full week of development for the project. We focused on finalizing the game mechanics, the user manual, and the test plan. We managed to implement the remaining features of the game, such as a better game optimization and the addition of new features. The user manual was completed and will be delivered with the project. The test plan was updated with the latest progress of the project and the test cases for the game. The absence of the project manager slowed down the progress of the project, but we managed to redistribute the tasks among the team members to make progress on various aspects of the project. We are confident that we will deliver a high-quality project by the end of the next week.
