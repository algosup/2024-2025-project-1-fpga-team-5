## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The primary aim of this project is to develop a Frogger game inspired by the classic 1981 version created by Konami, using FPGA technology and Verilog for implementation. The main objective of the game is to guide four frogs safely across a busy road and a flowing river while avoiding various obstacles such as cars and logs. Players must navigate each frog to their home.

### 1.2 Testing Scope
- The game will be available on both macOS and Windows platforms.
- The interface and controls are user-friendly.
- All game features, including movement and collision mechanics, are implemented.

## 2. How to Set Up

## 3. Test Tools

Test tools refer to the various materials and instruments that will be employed throughout the testing process.

### 3.1 Software
For this project, we will use FPGA technology and Verilog due to the extensive possibilities it offers. Verilog provides greater flexibility in design, enabling direct control over hardware implementation while also optimizing resource usage. This combination ensures that we can achieve high performance and efficiency in our system design.
