# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a strong focus on the kick-off and initial planning stages. We engaged with the client to understand their requirements and began the development of the videogame "Frogger"

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - The client provided a detailed briefing, clarifying their expectations and addressing any ambiguities from the initial brief received in late April.
2. **Planning**
   - We outlined the project's steps and created a comprehensive Gantt Chart to guide our timeline and milestones.
3. **Functional Specifications**
   - We have drafted most of the functional specifications document, laying a solid foundation for the technical specifications.
4. **GitHub templates**
   - We created a GitHub repository and set up templates for issues and pull requests to ensure a structured and organized workflow.
5. **First graphical display**
   - We managed to display some elements on the screen, we'll then be able to display the whole game soon.

## Challenges

1. **New Team Dynamics**
   - As a newly formed team, with many first-year students, we spent time understanding our roles and responsibilities, requiring substantial initial research.
2. **Learning FPGA / Verilog**
   - As the project involves developing a videogame on an FPGA board, we faced a steep learning curve in understanding the hardware and software requirements.
3. **Absence of a student**
   - Even if the year just started, we're already facing the absence of a student, one of our two software engineers, Séréna. Even if we might be able to manage without her, it's still a loss for the team.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Functional Specifications**
   - Finalize the functional specifications, allowing room for adjustments as the project progresses.
2. **Pursue Technical Specifications**
   - Begin drafting the technical specifications, focusing on the hardware and software requirements for the project.
3. **Start the Test Plan and User Manual**
   - Begin drafting the test plan and user manual to ensure a structured approach to testing and user guidance.
4. **Continue the development of the game**
   - Continue the development of the game, by being able to display on the screen elements but also by starting the movement implementation.

## Conclusion

The project started a bit slowly, but we succeded to get a good start. All the team members are motivated and want to make this project a success. Even if we know the worse is yet to come, we're confident in our ability to face the challenges ahead and deliver a great project.
