# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This week, we continued the development of the project by focusing on the game mechanics and the technical specifications. We managed to implement the movement of the frog and the obstacles on the screen. We also worked on the collision detection and the level increase system to make the game more challenging. The absence of the project manager slowed down the progress of the project, but we managed to redistribute the tasks among the team members to make progress on various aspects of the project. Furthermore, the second SE left the school, which might impact the project in the future.

## Accomplishments

1. **Game Development**
   - We continued the development of the game by focusing on the movement of the frog and the obstacles. We managed to implement the movement of the frog and the cars on the screen.
   - We also worked on the collision detection between the frog and the obstacles to make the game more realistic.
   - The level increase system was implemented to make the game more challenging as the player progresses.
   - The game over and game win conditions were implemented to provide a clear end to the game.
2. **Technical Specifications**
   - The technical specifications document is finalized and merged into the main branch. It details the technical requirements of the project.
3. **User Manual**
   - The user manual is pursued and will be completed next week. It details the instructions for the users to play the game.
4. **Test Plan**
   - The test plan document is updated with the progress of the project and the test cases for the game.

## Challenges

1. **Absence of the Project Manager**
   - Our project manager was absent this week, which slowed down the progress of the project. We had to redistribute the tasks among the remaining team members.
2. **Game Development**
   - The memory optimization of the game was challenging, as we had to reduce the LUT consumption to fit the game on the FPGA board.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Game Development**
   - Pursue the development of the game by focusing on the optimization of the memory consumption and the addition of new features.
   - Try to display sprites on the screen to make the game more visually appealing.
2. **User Manual**
   - Finalize the user manual to provide a comprehensive guide for the users.
3. **Test Plan**
   - Finalize the test plan document and merge it into the main branch.

## Conclusion

This week was challenging due to the absence of the project manager, but we managed to make progress on various aspects of the project. We are looking forward to the next week to finalize the user manual and pursue the development of the game. We are confident that we will overcome the challenges and deliver a high-quality project.
